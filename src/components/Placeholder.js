# Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

### Let's start with some code as usual: 

Inline like \`Math.random()\`. Or bigger:

\`\`\`javascript
function checkWeather(weather) {
  switch (weather) {
    case "sunny":
      return "🌞🌅";
    case "rainy":
      return "🌧️💧";
    default:
      return "👽🌌";
  }
}
\`\`\`
### Now we're switching the channel:

Usage of italics include denoting titles like *Bhagavad Gita*. Basically, names of things are italicized. Movies, podcasts, books, albums, operas, foreign words.
On the other hand, bold texts **increases average read time!** It makes content more scannable. As everybody is a full-speed rat to consume more content these days, bold texts give us valuable things to take away **faster**. Make sure you don't use it too much like ~~**_that_**~~ though. 
Also, never more ~~long tutorials~~. Always make stuff.

Some movies I added on my watchlist that [Eckhart Tolle recommends](https://m.imdb.com/list/ls057211237/):

### In the meantime:

- The Incan Empire, the most expansive pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas, had a term for the **human body** in their language: *alpa camasca*. This phrase literally means **animated earth**.
- Universe consists 4% of atomic matter, or what we consider, normal matter. 23% of the universe is the dark matter, and 73% is the dark energy, what we previously thought an empty space. 
  - Invisible nervous system that runs the universe, connecting all things.
- There are still 2 billion people around the world without access to safely drinkable water.
