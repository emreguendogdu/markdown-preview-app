### Let's start with some codes as usual: 
You can do \`Math.random()\` between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`javascript
// or a multi-line code
function isHi(word) {
  if (word.toLowerCase() === "hi" || word.toLowerCase() === "hello") { 
    return true;
  }
}

Usage of italics include denoting titles like *Bhagavad Gita*. Basically, names of things are italicized. Movies, podcasts, books, albums, operas, foreign words.
On the other hand, bold texts **increases average read time!** It makes content more scannable. As everybody is a full-speed rat for consuming content these days, bold texts give us valuable things to take away **faster**. Make sure you don't use it too much like ~~**_that_**~~ though. 
Also, never more ~~long tutorials~~. Always make stuff.
