### And here's some other cool stuff:

Heres some inline code; \`<div></div>\` between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`javascript
// or a multi-line code

function sayHi(word) {
  if (word.toLowerCase() === "hi" || word.toLowerCase() === "hello") {
    return true;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
